### Problem Description : 
1. When you pass a large text to Open AI, it suffers from a 4K token limit. It cannot take an entire pdf file as an input
2. Open AI sometimes becomes overtly chatty and returns irrelevant response not directly related to your query. This is because Open AI uses poor embeddings.
3. ChatGPT cannot directly talk to external data. Some solutions use Langchain but it is token hungry if not implemented correctly.
4. There are a number of solutions like https://www.chatpdf.com, https://www.bespacific.com/chat-with-any-pdf, https://www.filechat.io they have poor content quality and are prone to hallucination problem. One good way to avoid hallucinations and improve truthfulness is to use improved embeddings. To solve this problem, I propose to improve embeddings with Universal Sentence Encoder family of algorithms (Read more here: https://tfhub.dev/google/collections/universal-sentence-encoder/1). 

### Solution: What is DouDou Chat?
1. DouDou Chat allows you to chat with an uploaded PDF file using GPT functionalities.
2. The application intelligently breaks the document into smaller chunks and employs a powerful Deep Averaging Network Encoder to generate embeddings.
3. A semantic search is first performed on your pdf content and the most relevant embeddings are passed to the Open AI.
4. A custom logic generates precise responses. The returned response can even cite the page number in square brackets([]) where the information is located, adding credibility to the responses and helping to locate pertinent information quickly. The Responses are much better than the naive responses by Open AI.
5. Enables APIs on Production using **[langchain-serve](https://github.com/jina-ai/langchain-serve)**.
